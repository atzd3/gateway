Your question appears to be regarding a failure in a 'Datafix' job related to NACHA, and it's failing due to an issue with source control server determination and an error returned by 'TF.exe'. The 'TF.exe' is a command line tool used to interact with Azure DevOps Server (formerly Team Foundation Server or TFS). 

There are several possibilities that could cause these types of errors. Here are a few troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Source Control Server**: Verify whether your source control server is operational and accessible. Check your network connection and ensure that firewall rules are not blocking your access.

2. **Verify TF.exe Path**: The system might not be able to find the 'TF.exe' file. Make sure the TF.exe location is correctly defined in the system path or in your script. The 'TF.exe' is usually located in the `Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer` directory of your Visual Studio installation path.

3. **Correct Usage of TF.exe**: If the system can find the 'TF.exe', but it still returns an error, you may want to verify the usage of TF.exe in your scripts or commands. Make sure that the arguments and options are correctly defined. You can check the syntax and usage details by running `tf /?` in the command prompt.

4. **User Permissions**: Check if the user running the Datafix job has the necessary permissions on the source control server. This includes read/write access to the necessary repositories and branches.

5. **Source Control Bindings**: The error might be due to the incorrect bindings in your project. Ensure the project/solution is correctly bound to the source control.

6. **Workspace Settings**: There could be an issue with the workspace settings. Make sure that the workspace is correctly mapped and files can be fetched and updated without any issue.

7. **Log Details**: If none of the above works, please check the detailed logs of the build step and the Datafix job. The logs might have more detailed information about the error and can help in identifying the root cause.

Remember, it's also always a good idea to keep your tools up to date. If you are using an older version of Azure DevOps Server or TF.exe, consider updating them.
